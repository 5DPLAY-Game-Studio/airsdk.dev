**AIR SDK 51.2.0.1** has been released to beta by Harman.  

:::info From Andrew:
Finally, our first 51.2 BETA version is available for download. There are a number of issues we found whilst testing and we resolved those we felt to be showstoppers. There are other issues outstanding that we'll address now, with an updated beta version coming out once we've sorted those (plus the latest updates from 51.1 will be merged in).

:::warning Beta
[Feedback and bug reports](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/issues/new/choose) are welcome, of course! But please don't use this in any production software.
